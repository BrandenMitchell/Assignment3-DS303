Using Queue and stuff

// the code will practically run itself, on launch the code will go through a set couple of instructions given to it in the main.cpp (see for further information) these will be simple things like creating a q , add and delete, front, is empty etc.




Afterwards the program will then ask you to pick an item in the q youd like to find the last occurence of, once you input your number and hit enter it will run with the rest of the code, first displayed will be finding the number youre looking for then after it will auto run the code for using insertion sort so it will auto sort the given q





thanks for using
